The text keeps referring to this tool which I understand is now called Jupyter notebook. 
https://ipython.org/notebook.html


>C:\Python\Python35-32>pip3 install --upgrade pip
>Requirement already up-to-date: pip in c:\python\python35-32\lib\site-packages

__(Use pip if using legacy Python 2.)__

>C:\Python\Python35-32>pip3 install jupyter
>c:\webStormWS\BigData\GrokkingDeepLearning>jupyter notebook
> will start server

> iPython server gives same result

Hello World!
What's your name?Alex
Hello Again, Alex
I like typing this.
This is fun.
Yay! Printing.
I'd much rather you 'not'.
I "said" do not touch this.
